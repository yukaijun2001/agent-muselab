"""Frontend static lint — narrow but high-value checks for bug classes that
already shipped once. These read frontend/ as plain text; no JS runtime
needed.

Why this exists: JS object literals silently shadow earlier definitions when
the same key appears twice. We hit this in the multi-tab sprint
(2026-05-17) — a second `closeChatTab(...)` was added below the first one
and the upper definition was lost without any warning. The duplicate sat
undiscovered until a button stopped working. Pytest is the cheapest
guard."""

#   the keyword as the name. Without this, `async closeChatTab` matched as
#   `async` and missed the real collision.
# - Excludes arrow assignments (`const foo = () =>`) and `function ` decls.
# `(?!\{)` negative lookahead excludes calls like `_report({ ... })` where
# the open paren is immediately followed by a `{` (object literal arg). A
# real method def starts with `name(arg…)` or `name()`, never `name({`.
