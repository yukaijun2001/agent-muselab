"""Dump the bundled CLI's live built-in tool catalog, one name per line.

The CLI announces its full tool list in the `init` SystemMessage of every
session — that IS the programmatic catalog. This probe spins up a throwaway
1-turn session in /tmp, captures that list, filters MCP tools
(muselab-injected, not CLI-bundled), and prints it sorted — ready to diff
against docs/tool-catalog.txt:

    .venv/bin/python scripts/dump-tool-catalog.py | diff docs/tool-catalog.txt -

Run on every SDK bump (checklist item 1). A new line on the right that is
harness-only (plan-mode / cron / worktree / notification primitives with no
muselab UI) belongs in `disallowed_tools` in backend/chat.py; a useful tool
(new editor/search verb) should be left exposed and noted in the bump PR.
