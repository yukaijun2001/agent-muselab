"""CRUD + bell-chip read/ack endpoints for the scheduler.

GET    /api/scheduler/tasks         — list + current unread count
POST   /api/scheduler/tasks         — create
PATCH  /api/scheduler/tasks/{id}    — edit (rename / change time / toggle enabled)
DELETE /api/scheduler/tasks/{id}    — remove (does NOT delete the bound session)
GET    /api/scheduler/history       — most-recent-first run log
DELETE /api/scheduler/history       — clear ALL history entries
DELETE /api/scheduler/history/{ts}  — delete a single history entry (by timestamp,

POST   /api/scheduler/ack           — mark unread = 0 (called when user opens the bell drawer)
