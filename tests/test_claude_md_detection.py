"""Tests for the extended CLAUDE.md detection in context_info().

Covers:
  - Multi-source scanning (project / project_local / project_dot / user /
    subdir:<name>) — make sure the union surfaces, not just the canonical
    project-root file.
  - The filled-vs-template heuristic — install scripts seed a 100+ line
    bilingual template; that must NOT count as "Muse knows you".
  - Back-compat fields (claude_md_exists / lines / mtime) — anything that
    consumes the old shape must keep working.
