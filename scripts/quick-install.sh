# muselab — one-line bootstrap installer
#
# Designed to be piped from curl:
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hesorchen/muselab/main/scripts/quick-install.sh | bash
#
# What it does:
#   1. Detects OS (Linux + WSL / macOS — other platforms refuse)
#   2. Installs `uv` (the only Python prerequisite) if missing
#   3. Clones https://github.com/hesorchen/muselab → ~/muselab
#      (or prompts for a different dir; refuses to clobber an existing
#      checkout without consent)
#   4. Hands off to scripts/install-{linux,macos}.sh — those scripts know
#      how to register the systemd-user / launchd service, create .env,
#      pick a port, and so on. We don't duplicate their logic here.
#
# Why a separate bootstrap and not just curl|bash → install-linux.sh:
#   install-linux.sh runs FROM INSIDE the repo (it does `cd "$(dirname …)/.."`),
#   which assumes the repo is already cloned. Piping it directly would land
#   in /dev/stdin and fail with "scripts directory not found". This script
#   wraps clone + exec so users get one command.
#
# stdin tracking: when piped from curl, our own stdin is the pipe — `read`
# won't work. We re-attach /dev/tty for our interactive prompts AND for the
# underlying platform installer (which also uses `read`).
