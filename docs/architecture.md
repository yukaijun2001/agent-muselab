## Key design decisions

- **SDK over raw API.** Claude Agent SDK (same engine as Claude Code), so MCP / Skills / Subagents / plan mode / `CLAUDE.md` auto-load behave uniformly across providers. New providers: see [add-provider.md](add-provider.md).

- **Per-session `env=` override.** Third-party providers are wired by setting `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` + an isolated `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` ([`backend/endpoints.py:L851`](../backend/endpoints.py#L851)). The last one blocks the CLI from silently falling back to Pro OAuth and routing third-party traffic through your Anthropic account — the full mechanism is in [Model routing § env injection](routing.md#3-third-party-env-injection).

- **No build step.** Edit `frontend/`, refresh the browser. Vetted third-party libs live in `vendor/` (licenses in [THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md](../THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md)); installation never touches npm.

- **Client cache keyed by `(session_id, model, effort)`** ([`backend/chat.py:L303`](../backend/chat.py#L303)). Switching model or reasoning effort lands on its own pooled client; each assistant message stores its own `model` field so badges stay accurate after reload. Pool cap, LRU rules: [Model routing § client pool](routing.md#2-the-client-pool).

- **Whole-file as the unit of input.** `MUSELAB_ROOT` is a directory you own; the root-level `CLAUDE.md` auto-loads on every conversation. The assistant reaches files via Read / Grep / Edit on demand — no pre-embedding.

## Directory map

Two roots matter at runtime: the **repo** (code + per-install state) and the
**archive** (`MUSELAB_ROOT`, your own files). They are deliberately separate so
you can back up or move your data without touching the install.

```

The actual conversation transcripts are owned by the Claude CLI, not muselab:
they live under `~/.claude/projects/<cwd-key>/<session-id>.jsonl`. muselab's
`sessions/` only holds the metadata layered on top (names, per-message model
badge, cost, uploaded attachments). See
[Data & backup](data-and-backup.md) for the full back-up list.

## A request, end to end

A chat turn is one Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream:

1. **Browser → backend.** `GET /api/chat/stream` with the prompt, session id
   and chosen `model` as query parameters
   ([`backend/chat.py:L5043`](../backend/chat.py#L5043)). The auth token rides
   as `?token=` because `EventSource` cannot set headers
   ([Security model § authentication](backend-security.md#authentication)).
2. **Model resolution & lock.** The session is locked to one model
   (`sessions.py`). The first turn pins it; later turns reuse it so a
   conversation never mixes vendors mid-stream (cross-vendor *thinking
   signatures* don't transfer). A session created before any provider existed
   self-heals to a configured model on its first real send.
3. **Client pool.** `chat.py` fetches or spawns a `ClaudeSDKClient` keyed by
   `(session_id, model, effort)`. For a third-party model it sets
   `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` + an **isolated**
   `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` so the CLI can't fall back to your Pro OAuth and bill the
   wrong account.
4. **Agent loop.** The SDK spawns the `claude` CLI subprocess, which runs the
   full loop — tool calls (Read/Grep/Edit/Bash), MCP servers, skills, plan mode
   — against your archive as the working directory.
5. **Backend → browser (SSE).** Tokens, tool-call events, and a final `done`
   event stream back. The turn is published through a `TurnBroadcast`, so a
   browser disconnect never kills the reply — reconnecting replays the buffer
   ([Model routing § SSE turn loop](routing.md#4-the-sse-turn-loop)). The
   frontend renders incrementally; each assistant message records its own
   `model` so badges stay correct after reload.
6. **Persistence.** The CLI appends the transcript to its JSONL; muselab writes
   the sidecar (cost, model, attachments). If the turn was long and Web Push is
   configured, a completion notification fires even with the tab closed.

Scheduled runs ([scheduler.md](scheduler.md)) take the same path from step 3,
minus a human — they run unattended with the full permission set.
