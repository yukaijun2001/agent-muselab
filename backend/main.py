    - `Referrer-Policy: same-origin` — auth token rides in some query strings
      (SSE / file download — see auth.py docstring). Without this, clicking a
      link from muselab to github.com would leak the full URL (token included)

    - `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` — the HTML preview iframe is same-origin
      (served via `/api/files/read`), so this doesn't block it; what it DOES
      block is some external site embedding the muselab UI in a frame to
      phish credentials.

    Deliberately NOT setting:
    - `Content-Security-Policy` — the UI relies on Alpine.js inline directives
      (`x-on:`, `@click`, `:class`) and many inline `<script>` tags. Strict
      CSP would require either nonce-per-request rewrites or eval-script
      allowances; not worth the maintenance for a single-user app.
