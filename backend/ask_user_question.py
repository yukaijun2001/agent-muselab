"""
ask_user_question — muselab's analogue of Claude Code's AskUserQuestion.

Flow:
  1. Model calls `mcp__muselab__ask_user_question` with a list of questions
  2. Our in-process MCP handler:
     a. Generates a question_id, creates an asyncio.Future
     b. Pushes the question to the session's SSE event queue (forwarded to UI)
     c. await future (with 10-min timeout)
  3. User clicks a button in the UI
  4. Frontend POSTs to /api/chat/answer/{session_id}/{question_id}
  5. submit_answer() resolves the Future
  6. Handler returns the user's choice as a tool result
  7. Model continues, sees the answer in tool_result block

The handler captures session_id via closure — each ClaudeSDKClient instance
gets its own handler bound to its session. This avoids ContextVar propagation
issues across SDK-managed tasks.
