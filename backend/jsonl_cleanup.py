"""Strip thinking blocks with invalid signatures from Claude Code
session JSONLs, so the session can be resumed via the official Claude
API (or `claude --resume`).

Why this exists:

  When muselab routes a chat through a third-party Anthropic-compat
  endpoint (DeepSeek / GLM / MiniMax / Kimi / Qwen / Baidu / Xiaomi
  MiMo, etc.), those vendors' responses include `thinking` content
  blocks but the `signature` field is either missing, empty, or a
  short non-cryptographic placeholder. Anthropic's real API verifies
  the signature on every assistant message it ingests during resume,
  and 400s with `Invalid signature in thinking block`. End result:
  any session created against a third-party vendor cannot be resumed
  with `claude --resume` once the model is later switched to Claude.

  The fix is to drop the bad thinking blocks from the JSONL. We keep
  the surrounding text blocks (the actual visible answer) untouched —
  thinking blocks are model-internal scratchpad that the user has
  never seen and that future turns don't depend on. If a message
  ends up with zero content blocks (rare: vendor returned only
  thinking + no text), we insert a one-line placeholder so the
  message stays structurally valid (Anthropic rejects empty content
  arrays).

Public API:

  clean_jsonl(path)            — clean a single .jsonl file in place,
                                 atomic write, returns CleanupReport
  clean_all_under(root)        — recursive sweep, returns
                                 list[CleanupReport]
  is_invalid_thinking(block)   — True if a content block looks like
                                 the unverifiable kind

# A thinking block written by Claude itself carries a long base64 ed25519
# signature (typically ~88 chars). Third-party vendors either omit the
# field entirely, ship an empty string, or use a placeholder shorter
# than ~40 chars. We treat anything under MIN_SIG_LEN as suspect.
#
# FRAGILITY NOTE (known, documented — see audit D/232): this is a pure
# LENGTH heuristic, not signature verification. It assumes Claude's real
# signatures stay comfortably above 40 chars. If Anthropic ever ships a
# shorter (but still valid) signature format, those legitimate Claude
# thinking blocks would be misclassified as invalid and DROPPED here —
# silently losing real reasoning content. We accept this because (a) we
# can't verify the ed25519 signature ourselves without Anthropic's public
# key, and (b) the cost of a missed strip (resume 400s) is recoverable,
# while the current ~88 vs <40 gap is wide. If signatures shrink, revisit
# this threshold (or switch to a vendor allowlist) before it bites.
MIN_SIG_LEN = 40

# Placeholder content block we insert when stripping all content from a
# message would leave it empty (Anthropic API rejects empty content[]).
