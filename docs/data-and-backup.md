# Data & backup

> [简体中文](data-and-backup_zh.md)

muselab keeps no database — all state is plain files in three places:

1. the **archive** (`MUSELAB_ROOT`) — your own files,
2. the **repo** — config and session metadata,
3. **`~/.claude/`** — the Claude CLI's transcripts and login.

To migrate a muselab install to a new machine, copy the three "must back up"
sets below. Everything else regenerates on its own.

## What to back up

| Path | Contains | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| `$MUSELAB_ROOT/` | Your archive — every file you put there | This *is* your data |
| `$MUSELAB_ROOT/.muselab/scheduler.json` | Scheduled tasks + run history | Lose it = recreate every schedule |
| `<repo>/.env` | All config **including secrets** (token + provider keys) | Holds credentials — back up securely, never commit |
| `<repo>/sessions/` | Session index, per-message sidecars (cost, model badge, uploaded attachments), pending queues | muselab-only metadata, not in the CLI transcript |
| `<repo>/mcp.json` | MCP server configuration | Only if you configured MCP |
| `<repo>/provider_overrides.json` | Edits to built-in providers + any custom providers | Only if you customized providers |
| `~/.claude/projects/<cwd-key>/*.jsonl` | **The actual conversation transcripts** | The real chat history — owned by the CLI |
| `~/.claude/.credentials.json` | Claude Pro/Max OAuth login | Skip and you just re-run `claude login` |

> `.env` and `~/.claude/.credentials.json` contain secrets. Back them up to a
> private location; do not put them in a git repo or shared drive.

## What you don't need to back up

These are regenerated automatically:

| Path | Note |
|---|---|
| `$MUSELAB_ROOT/.muselab/vapid.json` | Web-push keypair — regenerates, but deleting it forces every device to re-subscribe |
| `$MUSELAB_ROOT/.muselab/push_subs.json` | Push subscriptions — devices re-subscribe on their own |
| `$MUSELAB_ROOT/.muselab-dustbin/` | Soft-delete trash, auto-purged after `MUSELAB_TRASH_TTL_DAYS` |
| `/tmp/muselab-vendor-cli-config-*` | Ephemeral isolated CLI config for third-party providers |
| `<repo>/.venv/`, caches, logs | Rebuilt by `uv sync` / at runtime |

## Restore on a new machine

1. Install muselab normally (see [Quick start](quickstart.md)).
2. Stop the service.
3. Restore `$MUSELAB_ROOT/` (including its `.muselab/scheduler.json`),
   the repo's `.env` / `sessions/` / `mcp.json` / `provider_overrides.json`,
   and `~/.claude/`.
4. Make sure `MUSELAB_ROOT` in the restored `.env` points at the archive's new
   location.
5. Start the service. Sessions, schedules, and history come back as they were.

A quick health check after restore: `bash scripts/doctor.sh`.
